1) CLUES: grep CLUE crimescene
CLUE: Footage from an ATM security camera is blurry but shows that the perpetrator is a tall male, at least 6'.
CLUE: Found a wallet believed to belong to the killer: no ID, just loose change, and membership cards for AAA, Delta SkyMiles, the local library, and the Museum of Bash History. The cards are totally untraceable and have no name, for some reason.
CLUE: Questioned the barista at the local coffee shop. He said a woman left right before they heard the shots. The name on her latte was Annabel, she had blond spiky hair and a New Zealand accent.

Annabel Sun- Ms. Sun has brown hair and is not from New Zealand.  Not the witness from the cafe.
Annabel Church- Interviewed Ms. Church at 2:04 pm.  Witness stated that she did not see anyone she could identify as the shooter, that she ran away as soon as the shots were fired.

However, she reports seeing the car that fled the scene.  Describes it as a blue Honda, with a license plate that starts with "L337" and ends with "9"

"You found two witness interview files. Take a look inside both of them and save any useful information into a new file called 'interview_info.txt'.

You feel satisfied that you have covered your tracks - time to consolidate your files. Commit the file but DON'T PUSH IT YET!

First checkout back into the 'main' branch, and merge the 'step-5' branch into 'main'."
